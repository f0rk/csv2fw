Convert csv files to fixed-width files.

Call csv2fw with -h for help.

Requires python.


The first argument is expected to be a file which defines the field name and
end position for output value, e.g.:

foo   4
bar   8
herp  12
derp  20

Would specify a file where the first field "foo" is positions 1-4, "bar" is
5-8, etc.

After that, it takes 0 or more arguments of files to process. If not files or -
is given, standard in is read.

Examples:

cat /tmp/some_csv_junk.csv | csv2fw /tmp/cuts.txt > /tmp/some_fixed_junk.txt
csv2fw /tmp/cuts.txt /tmp/some_csv_junk.csv > /tmp/some_fixed_junk.txt
